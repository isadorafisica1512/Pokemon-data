I developed an intelligent battle prediction system that forecasts Pokémon duel outcomes using machine learning. The core of this project is an XGBoost classifier trained on comprehensive battle data to determine which Pokémon would emerge victorious.
The central problem is that the dataset presents a simplified and mechanically inaccurate abstraction of Pokémon battles. While it contains the fundamental components (stats and types), it fails to capture the dynamic interactions that define the actual game and doesn't considers type advantage. This issue was found during the data analysis process
